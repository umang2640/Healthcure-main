# HealthCare: AI-Powered Multi-Disease Diagnosis Platform

- HealthCare: AI-Powered Multi-Disease Diagnosis Platform is a comprehensive diagnostic support system built on a robust and modern tech stack. 

- The platform integrates a multi-modal approach to disease prediction, utilizing both classical machine learning and deep learning

- For structured data inputs—such as age, blood pressure, and glucose levels—models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest are employed via Scikit-learn to predict conditions like heart disease and diabetes.

- For unstructured data, such as chest X-ray images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow or PyTorch is employed for pneumonia detection.

- The system architecture features a decoupled frontend (HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and optionally React.js) and a powerful Python backend (Flask/Django) connected via a REST API.

- This ensures a seamless and interactive user experience.

- User data and prediction results are securely stored in a Server. 

- Designed for scalability and easy deployment HealthCare serves as a vital tool for early health screening, telemedicine, and clinical support.
